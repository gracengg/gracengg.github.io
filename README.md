## Content and evidence

| Work | Published evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1Matrix | Experience summary and control-framework description | Design and implementation recommendations; no deployed-system or savings claim |
| Dickinson / CCLA | Experience summary and prototype scope brief | Supplied CCLA source is intermediate; individual records are not published |
| New-to-credit | Reviewed code, demonstration notebook and historical evidence audit | Original-data rerun pending; no validated deployment claim |
| NSDUH | Three original report screenshots and a methodology note | Coursework; descriptive and exploratory, not a validated clinical model |
| Apple equity risk | Public Python package, six supplied snapshots, executed notebook, tests and rebuilt risk tables | Complete-period historical analysis; no trading or causal claim |
| IMDb catalogue | Reviewed SQL package, local importer, executed notebooks and sixteen tests | Original database absent; public outputs use fictional verification records |
| Retail revenue | Public SQL queries, loader, reconciled growth bridge and identity audit | Teaching data; no retention or commercial uplift claim |
| Campus energy | Edited brief based on the April 20, 2025 fellowship report | Proposal; no adoption or realized savings claim |
| Credit and hiring ethics | Original course essay PDF | Philosophical argument, not legal guidance or empirical hiring research |
| Beauty and wages | Research summary | Supporting paper not supplied; no misleading download link |
| Helping behavior | Original course paper PDF | Hypothetical-scenario experiment and statistical analysis |

The CCLA workbook and supplied PBIX files are not public downloads. PBIX models may embed records; institutional source files must not be copied into this public repository. Do not present the NSDUH report exports as independently validated population estimates.

## Checks

Run from the repository root:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_site.py
node --check js/script.js
git diff --check
```

Also review the homepage and case-study pages in a browser at phone, tablet and desktop widths. Check mobile menu keyboard behavior, native disclosures, image loading and contact validation. The contact form opens a draft in the visitor's email application; it does not send through a server.

## Deployment

GitHub Pages builds from this repository's configured branch. Publishing here updates the final portfolio at the root URL. Canonical and social metadata use https://gracengg.github.io/.
